\title{Find the mean of  of the probabilistic dropout distribution function}
\usage{
mean_probdropout(mu, sigma2, rho, zeta, log = FALSE, approx = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{approx}{boolean. If TRUE match the probabilistic dropout
distribution to a skewed normal distribution and use its mean as an
approximation. If FALSE calculate the first moment using numerical
integration}
